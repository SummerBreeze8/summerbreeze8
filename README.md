Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 Mình hiện đang học tập và sinh sống tại Châu Âu
- 🌱 I'm currently learning English as a second language and Czech
- 😄 Pronouns: Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man how to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Nếu bạn không chê mình nghèo thì có thể lên xe mình đèo :>>
Cảm ơn bạn vì đã đọc
